# NYC Taxi ETL and SQL Analysis Project ðŸš–

This project builds a simple ETL pipeline and performs SQL-based analysis on NYC Yellow Taxi trip data using Databricks and Apache Spark.

## Project Structure

- `00_setup.ipynb`: Set up files for project.
- `01_ingest_bronze.ipynb`: Ingest raw `.parquet` file and write it as a Delta table (Bronze layer).
- `02_transform_silver.ipynb`: Clean column names, filter bad records, and store a refined Delta table (Silver layer).
- `03_aggregate_gold.ipynb`: Aggregate trip distances by passenger count and output Gold layer summary table.
- `04_data_analysis.ipynb`: Run SQL queries to explore trip trends by hour, vendor, and location.
